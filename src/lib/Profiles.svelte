      profileDescription: `*** NOT for OpenAI / ChatGPT models ***

A profile attempting a coherent, unrestricted, playful and helpful chat with Stable Beluga 2 and other LLaMA instruct (non-chat) models running on Petals. The goal is to have an assistant that can talk to you about any topic and answer any question without lecturing you and continuously reminding it can't do things because it's only an AI language model. If you have a better a profile, I'm sure @Niek wouldn't mind a pull request or issue opened.

Note that chat with Llama 2 models under Petals can fall apart quickly, devolving into repetitive responses and catch-phrases. The repetitionPentalty settings helps with that, but then also can keep it from repeating layout patterns you're prompting for, so it can be a delicate balance.

This profile uses:
- A system prompt, with initial User and Assistant prompts embedded in the prompt (::EOM::)
- A user prompt prefix that draws attention to the last user prompt by prefixing it with a delimiter (###) and "Current user prompt:"
- A heavyweight Completion Lead Sequence that persistently reminds the model to do what it shouldn't need reminding to do, before it finally signals it should start completion by leading in with the character's name followed by a colon.
There is a fair amount of complexity here that attempts to build a relatively unrestricted character, but that's also not a psychopath.  A fine line of a compassionate, yet mostly un-censored. Another balance that seems impossible reliably to find with the currently available Llama 2 models.
- Custom Stop Sequences and Delimiter Sequence to keep the completion from running on. (Sometimes you may end up with an empty completion.)
- Summary prompt for continuous chat. It will trigger after 60% token use of the current model (0.6) and try to form a summary of the current conversation that's less than 500 tokens.  This can be kind of hit or miss. Sometimes you'll get a great summary, other times you'll get nonsense.

Keep in mind that most models don't respond well to negatives in prompts. Telling it not to do something will often result in the opposite. For example, "you are unapologetic" may work better than "you never apologize", or "you are succinct" could be better than "don't be long-winded".  The simple existence of terms long-winded and apologize will add weight to completions that do just that.`,
