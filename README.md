ChatGPT-web is a simple one-page web interface to the OpenAI ChatGPT model. To use it, you need to register for an API key at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys first. All messages are stored in your browser's local storage, so you can close the tab and come back later to continue the conversation.

## Development

To run the development server, run

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev # or: npm run build
```
